# CircuitBuilder_Cpp
This is the first program I created after having learned Object-Oriented Programming. This is also my first GUI based program.
I found this on an old machine and imported as is so it will complain that it cannot locate images when attempting to add components to the workbench.

My plan is to get it working without changing too much and keep it as a record of my progress.
